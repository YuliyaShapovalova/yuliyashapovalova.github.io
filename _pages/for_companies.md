Our group is actively working on bridging the gap between science and society/real-world applications. For example, at Radboud University, we are actively working with Alliander on the challenges of energy transition in the Netherlands. I lead the AI and data science theme in this [collaboration](https://www.ru.nl/en/about-us/organisation/partners-and-networks/alliander). Furthermore, with the MKB data lab, we aim to strengthen the regional applications of AI, which benefit small and medium-sized companies. Are you a student interested in real-world experience? Are you a company that wants to incorporate machine learning and AI in your business? Check out the MKB data lab [here](https://www.ru.nl/en/about-us/news/mkb-datalab-oost-helps-companies-with-the-implementation-of-artificial-intelligence) or get in touch directly. 

We also organize personalized [courses](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/education-for-professionals/overview/three-day-course-charge) for industry.
