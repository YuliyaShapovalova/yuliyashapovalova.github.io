Industry Courses
-------------------------
We develop machine learning and AI industry courses. See an example [here](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/education-for-professionals/overview/three-day-course-charge).

Summer School at Radboud University
-------------------------
We started the first edition of the Summer School "Machine Learning for Time Series" in 2025 with the colleague Roel Bouman. 


Radboud University (2019-2025)
-------------------------
* Statistical machine learning (Master course)
I am giving the following lectures in this course: introduction to probability theory and Bayesian inference; Gaussian processes; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; variational inference. I am also supervising some of the practical sessions.
* Machine learning in practice (Master course)
I am supervising about three teams each year who participate in Kaggle competitions
* Research seminar data science (Master course): coordinator of the course in 2023. In this course we teach students to review scientific papers and cover recent advances in machine learning and data science.  

Maastricht University (2014-2017)
-------------------------
Problem based learning
* Probability theory
* Quantitative methods
* Quantitative business and statistics
